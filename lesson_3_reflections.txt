When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When we want to publish our work so that others can collaborate and contribute to it,
and also when we are using someone else's computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
We would prefer to do it manually because in case of
automatic updates, too many changes could take place.
