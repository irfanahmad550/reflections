When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When we want to publish our work so that others can collaborate and contribute to it,
and also when we are using someone else's computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
We would prefer to do it manually because in case of
automatic updates, too many changes could take place.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are copying repositories over github, clones are copying repositories from github to local repo or from local repo to local repo.
Branches are different commit history in the repository at different points in time.
We use a fork to copy someone's repo who doesn't let us modify the original, we use clone to make a local copy of github repo. We use branches to designate an alternate development path in the project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
When we have to go some place where we might not have an
Internet connection it is a good idea to have most recent update at remote stored locally.
